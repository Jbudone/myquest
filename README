====== Map/Page

	* Upon loading into the page/map, any existing movables are deleted, and then the current set of movables are added in

====== Promises

	* Promises only allow for 1 argument for .then(..); hence for multiple args wrap in { }

====== Eventful

	* triggeredEvents will append the event callback to the CONTEXT's event_callback_queue
